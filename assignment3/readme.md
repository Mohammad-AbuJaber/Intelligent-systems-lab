# Image Segmentation with Clustering Algorithms: Comparative Study

## Background
This case study explores and compares the effectiveness of clustering algorithms - K-means, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and DBSCAN - in image segmentation, a vital task in computer vision. Image segmentation involves dividing images into distinct regions based on pixel characteristics, with applications in background subtraction, object detection, and scene understanding.

## Objective
Evaluate the performance of K-means, GMM, and DBSCAN on a dataset of 4 to 8 RGB images, considering both qualitative and quantitative metrics. Tasks include experimenting with cluster numbers, tuning hyperparameters, and exploring the impact of feature space and data preprocessing.

## Dataset
Utilize a diverse collection of RGB images depicting various scenes and objects for evaluating clustering algorithms.

## Implementation
### Prerequisites
- Python
- Required Libraries: scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy, and relevant dependencies.

### Execution
1. Load the RGB image dataset.
2. Implement K-means, GMM, and DBSCAN clustering algorithms.
3. Experiment with cluster numbers and hyperparameters.
4. Evaluate performance qualitatively and quantitatively.
5. Analyze the impact of feature space and data preprocessing on clustering results.

## Conclusion
This case study provides insights into the suitability of K-means, GMM, and DBSCAN for image segmentation. By comparing results across different scenarios, including variations in feature space and data preprocessing, the study aims to highlight the strengths and limitations of each algorithm in diverse image datasets.
