# INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS LAB - ENCS5141

This repository contains solutions for assignments in the Intelligent Systems Lab course (ENCS5141). Below is a brief overview of the assignments:

## 1. Penguins Dataset Preprocessing
Explore the transformative power of preprocessing on the Penguins dataset. Tasks include loading the dataset, exploring its structure, handling missing values, analyzing feature relevance, encoding categorical variables, splitting the dataset, scaling numerical features, applying dimensionality reduction, and validating the preprocessing pipeline through machine learning model training.

## 2. Comparative Analysis: XGBoost vs. Random Forest
Compare the performance of XGBoost and Random Forest in various scenarios - handling noisy data, varying degrees of dimensionality, and large datasets. The analysis includes evaluation metrics, hyperparameter tuning, and computational efficiency considerations for both algorithms.

## 3. Image Segmentation with Clustering Algorithms
Conduct a comparative study on the effectiveness of clustering algorithms (K-means, GMM, and DBSCAN) for image segmentation. The tasks involve qualitative and quantitative assessments, experimenting with different hyperparameters, and exploring the impact of feature space and data preprocessing on clustering results.

## 4. CNN for Binary Classification with MNIST Dataset
Experiment with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for binary classification using the MNIST dataset. Train a specified 5-layer CNN, plot training accuracy, compute testing accuracy, and visualize misclassified images.
